# Walmart Porudct Information Retrieval Script

## Overview

This Python script is designed to retrieve information about Walmart products using their slugs. It makes use of the Piloterr API to fetch data and stores the results in a JSON file. The script utilizes concurrent programming for efficient processing and includes error handling mechanisms to handle HTTP and request errors.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure to set up the following:

- Python environment
- Required Python packages: `dotenv`, `requests`, `tqdm`, `termcolor`
- API Token: Obtain an API token from Piloterr and set it in the `.env` file.

## Usage

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install dotenv requests tqdm termcolor
```

2. Set up the API token:

- Create a `.env` file in the script directory.
- Add the following line with your Piloterr API token:

```plaintext
API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
```

- Change the `MAX_WORKERS` variable in the script to set the number of concurrent workers.
- Save the file.

3. Prepare the CSV file:

- Create a CSV file named `extract.csv` with a column containing Walmart product page slugs.

4. Run the script:

```bash
python walmart_product.py
```

## Results

The script outputs the retrieved products information in a JSON file named `results.json`.

It says it covers 240 sq.ft which is perfect for my living room. It has 3 different fan speeds, which is nice for different times of the day where you need it more or less. It has a timer and sleep mode which are super convenient so you don't have to think about it. I have noticed that it has helped a alot with the smell in my living room. My shower has been starting to grow mold so needs to be remodeled obviously, but in the mean time this has worked great to put in my bathroom also to clear out the air and mold smell. I would definitely recommend this air purifier and I think I'm gonna have to get me another one!",

I'm talking watery, itchy AND dry eyes, sinus pressure, which makes it impossible to breathe and sleep, a cough and sore throat, I could go on. Medicine helps, as well as household cleaning, but I have pets, smokers in the house, old furniture... It's just a disaster inside and outside with the pollen. Needless to say, this machine was desperately needed. Set up was easy peasy and it comes with everything. I was cautious about the radio wave disruptions, but when I researched it, they say just put it out of range if anything occurs. I didn't have anything happen at all even when right next to it, though. After setup, it really was just the waiting game. I don't know why it took me so long to get one, because this purifier is wonderful. It blows out all the cool, fresh air, and sucks up the bad stuff. Part of me can't wait to see what it looks like when I change my filter, but I know it'll probably be gross, lol. My hay fever is so bad that it debilitates me and my air quality is not good normally, but I actually feel a difference when this is on and running, which I was sooo skeptical about. It's not like I'm breathing dust and pollen anymore right after I clean or come from outside. It's not loud, either, which wasn't a worry of mine, but that's cool. The buttons are easy enough to use, too. I am just so glad I notice a difference in the air quality. It's almost as if I was breathing into a dusty, smoky, hairy mask at any given moment without this. I'm shocked at how much better it makes my life. It's awesome.",

My husband however fell for it and purchased these as a gift; though I objected, he went ahead and bought them and I am so glad he did! They're truly nonstick and have become my everyday pans. I make Korean pancakes and it's a nightmare cooking them on my other pans. With these, they don't stick at all and they come out crispy and perfect. To top it off they're very pretty to look at. Very happy with this buy and would definitely recommend to anyone.",

        "review_body": "I love the pots and pans, the reason for the 1 star is that the big pot has handles that heat up just like the pot itself. I burned myself and almost dropped it on my glass stove top. I wrote to the Company and never heard back from them. this was my second set, the first one has different handles that dont get hot. So this one here is a bad one to use. I added pictures of both to see the difference. If it wasnt for that handles on the pot on the left this would deserve a 5 star. Since I have not gotten any return message or call from Manufacturers I say Customer service is a -0",
